## About Me

I am an Android developer who has experienced every phase of a service—from development to launch and operation—at a startup.  

I delve deeply into problem-solving and enjoy collaborating with my team during code reviews to discover better solutions. I focus on writing clean, readable, and predictable code, and this approach has helped me build enduring services.  

Even amidst the rapid changes in the mobile market, I continually learn new technologies to develop services that offer greater convenience to users.  

I also cherish the time spent with colleagues over a ☕ cup of coffee, discussing our services and growing together as we create even better solutions.
